The Git workflow involves three main components:-
The working directory, the staging area (also known as the index), and the repository. Understanding how these components interact is essential for effectively using Git for version control.

1- Working Directory:
-> The working directory is where you do your actual work on the files. It contains the files of your project, and you can modify, add, or delete files as needed.
-> Changes made in the working directory are not automatically tracked by Git. Git only becomes aware of these changes when you explicitly tell it to do so.

2- Staging Area (Index):
-> The staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and the repository. It acts as a holding area for changes you want to commit.
-> Before committing changes, you need to add them to the staging area. This allows you to selectively include specific changes while leaving others out of the commit.
-> The staging area enables you to review and organize your changes before they become part of the permanent record in the repository.

3- Repository:
-> The repository is where Git permanently stores the committed snapshots of your project. It consists of the commit history, branches, and tags.
-> Commits in Git represent a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier (hash) and contains information about the changes made, the author, and a reference to its parent commit(s).
-> The repository is the central database that preserves the entire history of your project. It allows you to switch between different versions of your code, collaborate with others, and recover from mistakes.

Git Workflow Steps:
1- Initialize a Repository:
To start using Git, you typically initialize a new repository in your project directory using the git init command.

2- Add and Modify Files (Working Directory):
Make changes to your project files in the working directory.

3- Stage Changes (Staging Area):
Use the git add command to stage changes selectively or git add . to stage all changes.
The staging area allows you to review and organize your changes before committing them.

4-Commit Changes (Repository):
Once satisfied with the staged changes, use the git commit command to permanently save them to the repository.
Each commit creates a snapshot in the project's history.

5-Repeat (Working Directory, Staging Area, Repository):
Continue making changes, staging them, and committing them to the repository as needed.

Branching and Merging:
-> Git also supports branching, allowing you to create isolated environments for new features or bug fixes.
-> Branches can be merged back into the main branch when the changes are ready.
