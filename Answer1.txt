Verion Control:- Version control, also known as source code management (SCM) or revision control, is a system that helps track changes to files over time. It is commonly used in software development but can be applied to any project involving files that undergo modifications.

The primary goals of version control are:
1- History Tracking: Version control systems keep a record of changes made to files, allowing users to view and revert to previous versions.

2- Collaboration: Version control facilitates collaboration among multiple developers or contributors working on the same project.

3- Branching and Merging: Version control systems allow developers to create branches, which are isolated workspaces for making changes without affecting the main codebase.

4- Traceability: Developers can associate changes with specific issues or tasks, providing traceability and making it easier to understand why a particular change was made.

5- Backup and Recovery: Version control serves as a form of backup, providing a complete history of the project. 

Git, developed by Linus Torvalds, has become one of the most widely used version control systems, especially in open-source and collaborative software development projects.

Importance of version Control in Software development:-
1- Collaboration: In software development, multiple developers often work on the same project simultaneously.

2- History and Auditing: Version control systems maintain a comprehensive history of changes made to the codebase.

3- Error Detection and Correction: If a bug or issue is introduced into the code, version control helps identify when the problem was introduced and by whom. 
 
4- Rollback and Recovery: If an update or change causes unexpected issues, version control allows developers to easily roll back to a previous, stable version of the code. 

5- Branching and Parallel Development: Version control systems support branching, allowing developers to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation without disrupting the main codebase.

6- Code Review: Version control systems facilitate code review processes by allowing team members to review changes before they are merged into the main codebase.
